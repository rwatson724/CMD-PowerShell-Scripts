# CMD-PowerShell-Scripts
Scripts for the "Going Command(o): Power(Shelling) Through Your Workload" paper. 

Code was developed based on the environments and platforms I had available at the time. Code is not guaranteed to work on all environments and platforms. You are free to use the code and modify to fit your needs. We ask that you just cite where you got the original code from. If you have any questions or need help with some of the logic feel free to contact me at richann.watson@datarichconsulting.com or Louise Hadden at louise_hadden@abtassoc.com.
